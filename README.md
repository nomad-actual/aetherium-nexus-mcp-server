# aetherium-nexus-mcp-server

My collection of MCP tools

## Todo

- [x] Configuration
- [x] Docker pushing
- [x] Logging
- [x] Time tool (what did I mean by this)
- [x] Web search (searxng)
- [x] More complex weather forecast tool (as in tomorrow)
- [ ] Improve logging (not so noisy on weather)

### MVP

- [ ] Use embeddings loaded into file structure
- [ ] Notes archive first
- [ ] Documents via vector search
- [ ] Resume builder based on pasted job descriptions
- [ ] Shodan search for fun
- [ ] youtube summarizer
